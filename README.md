Hosted FirefoxOS Cub
====================

This is a base repo for my FirefoxOS hosted apps. I try to keep this app as a lowest common denominator. I include the tools that I like to use in my hosted apps. I have [another repo](https://github.com/arasbm/privileged-fxos-cub) that I use as a stub for privileged apps.
